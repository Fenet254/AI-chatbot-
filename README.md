🤖 AI Chatbot
Welcome to the AI Chatbot project
— a simple, flexible chatbot built for learning, experimenting, and evolving. Whether you're just getting started with conversational AI or planning to scale into multimodal territory, this repo gives you a clean foundation to build on.
🌟 What This Project Is About
This chatbot is:
- 🧠 A text-based conversational agent using Python
- 🧪 A sandbox for training and testing your own datasets
- 🛠️ A starting point for building smarter, more responsive bots
- 🚀 Designed to be extended — think images, voice, and more

🧰 How to Get Started
- Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Fenet254/AI-chatbot-.git
cd AI-chatbot-
- Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Train your model Make sure your dataset is formatted correctly (CSV with input/output pairs), then run:
- 
python train.py

- Chat with your bot Once trained, launch the chatbot:

- python main.py
- 🧠 How It Works
- The bot learns from example conversations in your dataset.
- It uses basic NLP techniques to match inputs and generate responses.
- You can customize the training logic or swap in more advanced models later.
🔧 Customize & Expand
Want to take it further? Try:
- Replacing the model with a transformer (e.g., GPT-2 via Hugging Face)
- Adding a web interface with Flask or Streamlit
- Connecting to a messaging platform like Telegram or Discord
- Training on domain-specific data (e.g., customer support, education)
📌 Notes
- This project is intentionally lightweight — perfect for experimentation.
- It’s a great way to learn the basics before diving into larger frameworks.
- Contributions, feedback, and forks are welcome!
